## Welcome to My Web Pages!

Hello everyone! I'm Yezhang Liu, a UCSD junior student who is trying to become a computer engineer. 

So far, I've familiarized myself with a few languages and tools, such as 
- languaes: C, C++, Java, Python, Assembly, SystemVerilog
- tools: matlab, github, rstudio, VSCode, etc
- **need to learn**: CSS, SQL, PHP, HTML and more

I've heard that we will use a lot of CSS this quarter. 
I hope it won't be like this:  
![meme2](./meme2.jfif)  
If I need to name my *top 3* favorite languages, they are:
1. C++
2. Java
3. Python
