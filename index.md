## Welcome to My Web Page

Hello everyone! I'm Yezhang Liu, a UCSD junior student who is trying to <br />
become a computer engineer. First of all, this simple page is made for practice <br />
using [Github](https://github.com/) flavored Markdown. I kinda love this tool. It is simpler and <br />more straight forward than HTML.

So far, I've familiarized myself with a few languages and tools, such as 
- languaes: C, C++, Java, Python, Assembly, SystemVerilog
- tools: matlab, github, rstudio, VSCode, etc
- **need to learn**: CSS, SQL, PHP, HTML and more

I love inspirational talks, and the one below is my favorite. 
> Don’t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do. – John Wooden

This quote sometimes inspires me when debugging. Then, coding for me <br />
becomes exciting. This is usually the night for me when I got stuck on a bug.  
![meme3](./3.jfif)
![meme4](./4.jfif)  

I know `ctrl+v` and `ctrl+c` are very powerful commands, but they <br />
are no good for my programming skills.

I've heard that we will use a lot of CSS this quarter. 
I hope it won't be like this:  
![meme2](./meme2.jfif) ![meme1](./meme1.jfif)   
If I need to name my ***top 3*** favorite languages, they are:
1. C++
2. Java
3. Python  

The list below is the progress of my New Year's Resolution:
- [x] keep my weight the same
- [ ] find an internship
- [ ] fall in love with a cute girl
- [x] solve and understand at least 50 problems on Leetcode per month  

I like to watch fun videos at my leisure. I know [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) is very popular,<br />
but I prefer [Bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) as my main fun video website. On Bilibili, <br />you can inteact with 
others via in-video comment while watching, and I really enjoy that.
